    You are amateur adventurers that have all been hired by a town merchant, Hudson McBay. 
    He is transporting a sack of 20 valuable stones from his town of Firebug to Fort Muck, 
    a local trading post. The trail between the two passes through a valley in the wilderness, 
    and he is afraid of being robbed by bandits. In exchange for protecting him, 
    he has offered you each 10% of his profits from selling the stones.
